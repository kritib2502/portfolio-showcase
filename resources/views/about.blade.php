 I'm a software development student at BCIT. I have always been passionate about coding and technology, and my goal is to become a skilled software developer who can create innovative solutions to complex problems.

<br>Throughout my studies, I have been exposed to various programming languages such as Javascript, PHP, and C#, and I have gained hands-on experience in software development methodologies. <br>I've worked on several projects which have allowed me to develop my problem-solving skills and gain valuable experience in the development process, from design to testing.
